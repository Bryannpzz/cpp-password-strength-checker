# C++ Password Strength Checker

This project is a simple C++ console application that evaluates password strength based on common security criteria such as length, character variety, and basic pattern checks.

The goal of this project is to connect C++ fundamentals with introductory cybersecurity concepts like defensive programming and password hygiene.

 Features
- Evaluates password strength (Weak / Medium / Strong)
- Scores passwords based on length and character variety
- Detects common weak patterns (e.g. "password", "1234")
- Provides clear feedback explaining why a password is weak or strong
- Does not store or log passwords

#Concepts Used
- Functions and modular design
- Input handling and validation
- Character analysis (`<cctype>`)
- Basic scoring logic
- Defensive programming principles

 How to Run
Compile and run using any C++ compiler. Example with `g++`:
